# Track_Invoice_Blockchain
rackomatron

Track invoices on the blockchain!

Overview

This software is intended to create a space to easily send invoices between and within institutions. Firstly, the commands of trackmatron are separated into two broad categories: submitting information to the blockchain (transactions), and retrieving information from the blockchain (query). The transaction commands are separated into three main categories:

Profile management
Open/edit/deactivate profiles
Sending Invoices
Sending and Editing capabilities
Send invoices intended to fulfill contracts
Send expense invoices
Paying invoices
Bulk payment of invoices from a single receiver
The querying information from the blockchain allows users so sort and retrieve profiles, invoices by payments in bulk, additional utility is provided to allow to generate quick totals of amount due between parties.

For a list of commands please see the section below Commands.

Install

For CLI testing to pass you must have jq installed

go get github.com/tendermint/trackomatron
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/tendermint/trackomatron
make all
These commands will generate the binaries in $GOPATH/bin named tracko and trackocli representing the full and light client respectively.

Example

Initialize/reset trackomatron, but don't start the chain

tracko init
tracko unsafe_reset_all
trackocli init --force-reset
Set up your trackocli with some keys

trackocli keys new bobby
trackocli keys new buddy
Update genesis so you are rich

trackocli keys get bobby -o json
vi ~/.tracko/genesis.json
-> cut/paste your pubkey from the results above
or alternatively:

GENKEY=`trackocli keys get bobby -o json | jq .pubkey.data`
GENJSON=`cat ~/.tracko/genesis.json`
echo $GENJSON | jq '.app_options.accounts[0].pub_key.data='$GENKEY > ~/.tracko/genesis.json 
Start the tracko node

tracko start
In a second terminal connect your trackocli the first time

trackocli init --chainid=test_chain_id --node=tcp://localhost:46657
Send some mycoins over to your pal so they can open a profile

ME=`trackocli keys get bobby -o json | jq .address | tr -d '"'`
YOU=`trackocli keys get buddy -o json | jq .address | tr -d '"'`
trackocli tx send --name=bobby --amount=1000mycoin --fee=0mycoin --sequence 1 --to $YOU
Open up some profiles

trackocli tx profile-open --profile-name=b0b --name=bobby --amount=1mycoin --fee=0mycoin --sequence=2
trackocli tx profile-open --profile-name=bud --name=buddy --amount=1mycoin --fee=0mycoin --sequence=1
Send an invoice to your pal! Then list the open invoices

trackocli tx contract-open --invoice-amount=99.99USD --date=2017-01-01 --to=bud --notes=thanks! --name=bobby --amount=1mycoin --fee=0mycoin --sequence=3
trackocli proof state invoices | jq
Great! Now you're ready to start using trackomatron to start invoicing all your friends!

Close up shop

In the first terminal window hit ctrl-c

Commands

Transaction commands can be executed from either a full operation node (heavy-client) or from a light-client brethren.

Client	Query	Transaction
heavy	tracko query [command]	tracko tx invoicer [command]
light	trackocli query app [command]	trackocli tx [command]
The --help flag can be used from any command to list available flags/args and their full usage. An overview of the commands available are as follows:

Query

invoice Query an invoice by ID
invoices Query all invoice
payment List historical payment
payments List historical payments
profile Query a profile
profiles List all open profiles
Transaction

contract-edit Edit an open contract invoice to amount
contract-open Send a contract invoice of amount
expense-edit Edit an open expense invoice to amount
expense-open Send an expense invoice of amount
payment pay invoices and expenses with transaction information
profile-deactivate Deactivate and existing profile
profile-edit Edit an existing profile
profile-open Open a profile for sending/receiving invoices
One cool flag I will mention to check out is the --sum flag used for querying invoices. This flag allows you to generate a total of all the invoice amounts due between two parties.

Testing

Comprehensive testing is performed in bash scripts found in test/ check them out! These files can give you a pretty good idea of to used some of the nuance capabilities of trackomatron. Note that these tests require the expect package which can be installed with

sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get install expect
In addition the golang test suite is utilized throughout for unit testing, this testing is presented in the "*_test.go" files throughout the repository.

Future Development

Store dumb-contracts on the blockchain
Reference documents to be stored in IPFS
State encryption to prevent external query of sensitive information
